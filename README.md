# Average Temperature Project

For this project, I needed to create a chart showing the average temperature by year over the past century. I wrote an SQL query using Google BigQuery to calculate the average, grouped the average temperatures by year, and ordered them in ascending order. For the line chart, I imported my data set from Google BigQuery to Google Looker Studio.
